# Progress Log

Use this file as the chronological implementation log. Each future Codex
target should append one entry before closeout.

## 2026-06-24 - Planning Baseline

Status:

- Added a persistent project plan in `docs/project_plan.md`.
- Added a long-running target prompt in `docs/codex_target_prompt.md`.
- Converted `TASKS.md` into a staged TODO ledger for the layered A/B/C project.

Known current blockers:

- The repository started without `.git`.
- `data/raw/` was not present at planning time.
- System Python was observed as too old in a prior check; future implementation
  should prefer bundled Python unless a suitable local runtime is installed.
- `make`, `docker`, and `uv` may be unavailable; future implementation must
  provide Windows PowerShell runners.

Next TODO:

- Initialize Git if still absent and commit the baseline.
- Start Phase 0 by upgrading the source-of-truth architecture, ontology,
  intents, manifest, and task ledger to the A/B/C contract.

## 2026-06-24 - Phase 0 Contract Upgrade (PLAN-003)

Task:

- Upgrade `docs/architecture.md` to align with the A/B/C multimodal disease-agnostic
  contract.

Commands run:

- Read source-of-truth files:
  `AGENTS.md`, `docs/project_plan.md`, `TASKS.md`, `docs/progress_log.md`,
  `docs/architecture.md`, `configs/ontology.yaml`, `configs/intents.yaml`,
  `data/source_manifest.yaml`.
- Updated `docs/architecture.md` content (layered architecture, contracts, flows,
  safety, quality gates, UI/API baseline).

Result:

- `PLAN-003` set to DONE.
- Architecture now defines explicit A/B/C layer scope and evidence/portable-delivery
  contract alignment for later tasks.

Blockers:

- `configs/ontology.yaml` and `configs/intents.yaml` are still inconsistent and will
  be handled by `PLAN-004` and `QA-CONTRACT-001` next.

Next:

- Continue with `PLAN-004` (ontology contract upgrade) using the same task order
  and validation rules.
